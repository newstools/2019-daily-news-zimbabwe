(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); According to Basics 4Zimhospitals founder, Tendai Nduku, proceeds from the event will be used to buy a variety of basic items badly needed by Zimbabwean hospitals. “All proceeds will go towards purchasing basic items required in Zimbabwean hospitals such as  painkillers, hand sanitisers, gloves, caps, aprons, bandages, needles, syringes, fluid  and blood giving sets, cannulas, chest drain bottles and urine bottles,” said Nduku. He added that they have lined up a variety of “exciting activities” at tonight’s fundraising event. “We will have braai and in addition to Zimbabwean and African food served. The main highlight of the night will be a performance by United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean DJ, Lady G2 who has won several accolades in the UK,” Nduku said. Basics 4Zim Hospitals was formed in London in April this year after a strike by Zimbabwean  public sector doctors– the second time in three months – citing a critical shortage of drugs, equipment and consumables in hospitals. The group has branches in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Apart from Nduku, Basics 4Zim Hospitals is run by a committee that includes Ezra Mbangani, Nyarai Banhire, Joseph Kunyeda and John Dhliwayo.
