© Viewers on DStv will need to gear up for a thrilling weekend of football action, as we bring you the “Beautiful Game” from the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The home of the Premier League on DStv will be SuperSport 3. DStv Compact customers and above will have access to the best matches of each round. The outstanding fixture of round six is clearly the meeting of Chelsea and Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday evening, with the Blues v Reds one of the great rivalries in English football in recent years. The clubs are in different stages of development, with Liverpool certainly one of the favourites to win the Premier League title, while Chelsea will be happy to finish in the top four in what is manager Frank Lampard’s first season in charge of the London team. The teams have already met once this season, playing out a 2-2 draw in the Uefa Super Cup final in Istanbul last month — Liverpool won the post-match penalty shootout. Last season the Reds took four points off the Blues in the teams’ league meetings: a 1-1 draw in London in September 2018 and a 2-0 win at Anfield in April, with goals from star African forwards Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. DStv subscribers from Premium to Family will have font row seats to all La Liga games. The pick of La Liga matches this coming weekend is the battle between Sevilla and Real Madrid from Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. The Andalusia team have shown great promise under Julen Lopetegui this season and the manager will be itching to get one over Real in this clash, having been dumped by the Madrid just a couple of months into last season. Sevilla famously defeated Real 3-0 in the teams’ last clash at the Sanchez Pizjuan (one of the results which helped hasten Lopetegui’s exit from Los Blancos), with goals from Andre Silva (two) and Wissam Ben Yedder. A repeat result would underline Sevilla’s ambition to break back into the top four and put further pressure on Real boss Zinedine Zidane.
DStv Family customers have a boosted offering of Serie A and will see all the matches, while Access customers will be able to catch two games a week. The pick of the matches in round four from the Serie A is undoubtedly the ‘Derby della Madonnina’ between Milan and Internazionale from the San Siro on Saturday night. This storied rivalry is one of the highlights of the fixture list and always produces fiery encounters. While the Nerazzurri have recruited Antonio Conte and turned themselves into title contenders, the Rossoneri are still finding their way under Marco Giampaolo. Yet claiming a win in the Milan derby is the best way to buy patience and faith from the supporters – for a couple of weeks at least! Don’t miss the 2019/2020 football season on DStv .
