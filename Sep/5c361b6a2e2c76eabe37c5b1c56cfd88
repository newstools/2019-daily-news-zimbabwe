Hamzawy will battle it out with other teens from around the globe in the Junior Model International, precisely in the Miss Pre-Teen category. Her mother Shamila El Hamzawy was over the moon following her daughter’s latest achievement. “It is an honour and we will do all we can to make her win. We are trying to raise funds for her and build hype around the event.”
Born on March 21, 2008, the young Hamzawy started her modelling career early this year. “She has a natural talent for modelling. From the tender age of four, ‘Miss Nana’ decided that she wanted to be a masseuse and a super model.” She was crowned Miss Teen Super Globe Zimbabwe on July 6.
