Karatekas from Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Ethiopia, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger as well as some Southern and Eastern African countries including Uganda, Zimbabwe and Kenya are taking part in the symposium. Reigning Annual National Sports Awards Sportsperson of the Year Mashaya said he is looking forward to learning more about the latest trends in martial arts. “I’m happy that I was chosen to represent the country at the congress; it motivates me to keep on doing my best in the field of martial arts both regionally and internationally,” Mashaya told the Daily News. Chirumanzi was equally pleased with the opportunity.
“The congress is a great platform to bring together marital artists from across Africa to network, brainstorm and bring about ideas that could help develop and empower women, youth and also male athletes who are involved in martial arts,” said Chirumanzu. “There’s vast talent in Africa, we have seen that in Zimbabwe where Samson Muripo has been crowned the first Africa to win the world title in Japan. “He beat the Japanese in their own backyard,” she said.
 They are so many Muripos out there that need to be helped in so many ways. “There are so many challenges that martial artists face that include lack of sponsorship, not just martial arts but across all the sport disciplines.”
