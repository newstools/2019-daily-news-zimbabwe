(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The event, organised by the Daily News, will be headlined by Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi who will be the guest speaker, celebrated award-winning human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission chairperson Elasto Mugwadi, Zimbabwe Peace Project director Jestina Mukoko, Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe president Bishop Never Muparutsa, MDC secretary for elections Jacob Mafume and Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans’ Association chairperson Chris Mutsvangwa. Tonight’s event comes on the back of the recent 10-day visit by United Nations special rapporteur Clement Voule to assess Zimbabwe’s human rights situation. It also comes against the backdrop of the alleged disappearance of 50 mostly civil society activists in the country. According to the organisers, the discussion forum, which has attracted the interest of government representatives, human rights activists, political parties and the church, has been organised to create a platform for State actors to interface with representatives of civic society to discuss the current human rights situation and proffer suggestions on how to chart a new course free of human rights controversies. “We are very excited to be organising the human rights discussion forum which will bring together diverse stakeholders (State and non-State actors alike) to discuss issues around the country’s human rights challenges,” Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ) chief operating officer Hama Saburi said. ANZ general manager (marketing) Francis Mushaninga has been encouraged by the high number of non-governmental organisations, human and civil rights defenders, political party representatives, parliamentarians, councillors, opinion leaders, labour unions, government representatives and diplomats  who have already registered for the event. “A cross-section of people from diverse fields has already registered. We are very happy about this because we are convinced that the human rights discussion forum will provide a catalyst for a new era for the country,” Mushaninga said.
